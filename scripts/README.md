# Data sync

Pulls real data from Klaviyo, LoyaltyLion and Shopify into Supabase.

## Setup

1. `cp .env.example .env`
2. Fill in the keys. `.env` is gitignored and must stay that way.
3. `npm install`

## Running it

```bash
node scripts/sync.mjs                                    # trailing 3 days
node scripts/sync.mjs --from 2026-06-01 --to 2026-06-30  # a specific range
node scripts/sync.mjs --from 2026-06-01 --to 2026-06-30 --dry-run
node scripts/sync.mjs --only shopify
node scripts/sync.mjs --from … --to … --force            # redo days already done
```

`--dry-run` fetches everything and prints what it *would* write, touching
neither the tables nor `sync_log`. Always worth doing first on a new range.

Tests (no network or credentials needed):

```bash
node scripts/test/sync.test.mjs
```

## Two revenue figures, on purpose

There are two Klaviyo revenue numbers in the database and they will not tie
out to each other. That is correct, not a bug.

| Figure | Basis | Where it lives | Answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Campaign / flow revenue | **Send date** | `klaviyo_campaigns.revenue_jod`, `klaviyo_flows.revenue_jod` | "How did that send perform?" |
| Attributed revenue | **Order date** | `shopify_daily_sales.klaviyo_attributed_revenue_jod` | "What share of the day's sales did Klaviyo drive?" |

A campaign sent on the 3rd that converts on the 7th books its revenue on the
3rd in the first figure and on the 7th in the second. The second is the one
that can be compared against Shopify's daily total, because both are dated by
when the order happened.

## Idempotency

Every write is an upsert against a unique index:

| Table | Key |
|---|---|
| `klaviyo_campaigns` | `campaign_id, campaign_message_id` |
| `klaviyo_flows` | `flow_id, flow_message_id, send_channel, date` |
| `klaviyo_push` | `source_type, source_id, message_id, sent_on` |
| `shopify_daily_sales` | `date` |
| `ll_snapshots` | `snapshot_date` |

Keys are the APIs' own ids, never names, so renaming a flow updates its row
instead of creating a duplicate. Re-running any range is always safe.

## Resuming a backfill

Klaviyo's values-report endpoints allow **2 requests per minute** and **225 per
day**. Flows need one call per day, so:

- 3 days ≈ 8 calls, about two minutes.
- 90 days ≈ 95 calls, about 45 minutes, and close to the daily cap.

Each flow day is written and logged to `sync_log` as it completes. If a
backfill is interrupted, hits the cap, or the machine dies, just run the same
command again: days already recorded as successful are skipped. `--force`
overrides that and redoes everything.

## What lands in sync_log

One row per source per chunk, so that in three months you can see what the
sync actually did rather than guessing:

`source`, `status`, `synced_at`, `range_start`, `range_end`, `rows_written`,
`duration_ms`, `message`.

Failures are logged too, with a redacted message.

## Secrets

Read from `.env` locally and from GitHub Secrets in CI (real environment
variables always win over `.env`). Every log line passes through a redactor
that strips known key values and anything key-shaped, so a failing API call
cannot echo a credential into a CI transcript. Nothing here is ever imported
by frontend code — the service-role key bypasses row-level security entirely.

## Known assumptions worth checking on the first real run

- **Points outstanding** is the sum of `points_approved` across all customers.
  Compare it against the LoyaltyLion dashboard once and confirm it matches.
- **Birthday rewards** are matched by looking for "birthday" in the rule name,
  since LoyaltyLion has no dedicated birthday activity type. The matched rule
  names are printed on every run; if a rule gets renamed you will see a warning
  rather than a silent zero.
- **Shopify totals** are `currentTotalPriceSet` for non-cancelled, non-POS
  orders, VAT-inclusive at 16% exactly as Shopify reports them. No VAT is
  stripped at fetch time.
